# Password Generator

## Description

This page acts as a random password generator. It prompts the user to choose a length for their password, then ensures that the number is between 8 and 128 characters long. It then asks the user to confirm which characters they would like to include in their password: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Once the user has given all their criteria, a random combination of those characters, of the specified length, is generated.
